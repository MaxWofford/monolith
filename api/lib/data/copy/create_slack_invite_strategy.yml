    This utility will walk you through building a custom Slack invite for your Hack Club.

    When you're done, you'll have a link which you can provide to members and have them join with your configuration.

choose_name: |
  What would you like to name this invite strategy?

  It'll be used in a URL (in the format hackclub.com/slack_invite/${NAME_GOES_HERRE}), so you want to make it short and rememberable.

  The default is "<%= name %>".
choose_club_name: What's the name of your club? (default is "<%= club_name %>")

  Here it is: <%= url %>
use_default: |
  OK. Setting the <%= key %> as default value, <%= val %>.
use_custom: |
  Cool! Setting the <%= key %> as <%= val %>.
